# Optimal Learning Website (GitHub Pages)

This is a static archive of the Optimal Learning site focused on the knowledge gradient. It has been updated to modern HTML5 while preserving the original look and feel, and improved for basic accessibility (semantic structure, alt text, skip links, keyboard focus states).

## What’s here

- `index.html` — Main landing page: overview, sections, software, applications, and readings
- `tutorialsciences.htm` — Tutorial series for laboratory sciences
- `_downloads.html` — Simple downloads/links page
- `Resources/` — Assets including `styles.css` and background image
- `images/` — Site images
- `Papers/`, `Course/`, `software/`, `TutorialLaboratorySciences/` — PDFs, docs, and referenced materials

## Local Development

To preview the website locally, you can run a simple web server from the root of the project directory. If you have Python 3 installed, you can use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

This will start a web server on port 8000. You can then open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the website.
